# `Angular commit watcher` â€” AngularJS test task apps

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

We also use a number of Node.js tools to initialize and test `angular-seed`. You must have Node.js
and its package manager (npm) installed.

### Install Dependencies

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`. After that, you should find out that you have
two new folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the Angular framework files

*Note that the `bower_components` folder would normally be installed in the root folder but
`Angular commit watcher` changes this location through the `.bowerrc` file. Putting it in the `app` folder
makes it easier to serve the files by a web server.*

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000/index.html`][local-app-url].
